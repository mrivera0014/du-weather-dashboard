# du-weather-dashboard

In this project I created a weather dashboard that allows the user to see the weather based on the city they search. When the user searches the desired city the weather for that current day will be displayed. Along with that the weather for the next five days will be displayed below the current day.

When it came down to starting this project I began with my the html file. I created all the tags that I knew I would need and added classes and/or id's that felt relevant at the moment. To see if the layout of the page was matching the way I had envisioned it, I added some generic text and background color. 

Then I started working on my JS file, first by declaring my variables like the query URL and API key since I knew that those would be needed. To make the process of writing my JS code easier I thought about in what order the user would interact with the web application. That is how I decided what functions to work on first and it definitely made a difference on how much I was able to get done in one sitting.

The part that consumed me a bit and prevented me from moving on with my code was that my ajax call kept propagating the five day forecast elements. I tried to fix it for about half an hour before letting it go for the time being but I found myself going back to try and fix it multiple times. This ended up consuming a lot of my time when I could have worked on other functions that could have made my weather dashboard fully functional.

I can say though, that I felt much more confident when I started this project. I was able to start and keep building on from what I knew I needed. Even though I was not able to finish my project, I was able to come out with a better understanding of how jQuery works such as, creating tags, adding classes, adding attributes, and a few other things.
